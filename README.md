**Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**

Welcome to my Titanic Survival Prediction project! In this repository, 
I've tackled the classic beginner project of predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. 
I've used the Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more. 
Through data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques, I've developed a model that predicts survival outcomes. 
Join me in exploring the world of data science and classification modeling.


**Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python**

Explore the realm of movie ratings prediction with this project! In this repository, 
I've worked on predicting movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. 
I've delved into data analysis, preprocessing, and various machine learning algorithms to build an accurate rating prediction model. 
By analyzing historical movie data, I've developed insights into factors influencing ratings. 
Join me on this journey to understand and predict movie ratings.


**Task 3: Iris Flower Classification**

Welcome to my Iris Flower Classification project! In this repository, 
I've taken on the task of classifying Iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements. 
Using the Iris dataset, I've demonstrated the process of data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning model training. 
Watch me as I navigate through introductory classification tasks, exploring the power of machine learning in identifying flower species. 
Join me in this exploration of the fascinating world of flower classification.


**Task 4: Sales Prediction using Python**

Predicting sales is crucial for businesses to plan effectively. 
This project focuses on developing a sales prediction model using Python. 
Exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and various regression algorithms are employed. 
The project covers model evaluation and improvement, providing insights into predicting future sales accurately.

**Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

Fraudulent credit card transactions pose significant risks to financial systems. 
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using Python. 
The dataset is preprocessed, imbalanced class issues are addressed, and classification models are trained. 
Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation help ensure accurate fraud detection while minimizing false positives.
